You can start your own timer(how long are you working/day) and you can see monthly work.
If you stop it that time update to monthly time.(for a test i change from hours to seconds preview.)

<h3>Update progress and todo:</h3>
Also there is a todo list and progress bar. They are connected to each other. Thats mean if u done task of any level(easy - 1%, medium - 2%, hard - 3%) it will update your progress bar. If you reach in progress bar 100% you gonna get a next level.
<br> TODO
<br>
In todo there is a sort. And it will show you only data with <= currentdate. If is > than current date. It will be avaiable to see when the current date === date what we select.
